1. Do you have any previous programming experience? 
   If so, what language(s)? If not, what are your initial thoughts about the C language and this course? 
=> I do not have any experience about doing programming. I feel difficulty during the class. However, I heard that C language has a long history. So I prefer to learn C language because I can find the more things in the books.

2.Describe your understanding of the compiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program. 
=>To create a program, you must first create a source file. A source file is a document written in C, so we need to turn it into a language that the computer understands. The process of turning source files into machine language is called compilation.

3.What do you hope to achieve in this course? Describe your goals and expectations. 
=> Actually, it is my first time to learn computer language. So I want to get the basic thesis during the class. After class, I can use this knowledge for more difficult computer language like C++.
