1.
A) I used two relational expressions. (== and <=)
First, the English characters that determine the type of coffee and add cream are lowercase and uppercase. I use uppercase == lowercase to indicate this. Also, I use <= to make the range of daily servings.

b) I used two relational expressions. (|| and &&)
There are lowercase and uppercase letters that determine the type of coffee and add cream. For example, when I type to make an input,  A capital L and a lowercase l are used interchangeably. In this case, I use || to make a light coffee result, even if I type either character.  And daily serving has the number of servings. For example, for 1 to 4 servings, I need to use && because the number must be greater than 1 and less than 4.

2.
Using DeMorgan's law, it can be expressed as (A ∩ B)C. This is because Product-1 and -3 have the same ID and they are not unique. 
Without using DeMorgan's rule, it can write (Product3_Id != Product1_Id && Product3_Id != Product2_Id).
In P1, I used relational expressions and logical expressions to express the logic: (Product3_Id == Product1_Id && Product3_Id == Product2_Id)

3.
1. When I declare a variable inside the code, it is necessary to write exactly what it is. I need to write down the coffee type, not just type, so that I can modify it later. 
2. If you want to add more variables, write each additional number "in order". For example, coffee_type3 should not be followed by coffee_type90. When I declare all variables, it should be written in order.(ex-Coffee_type1, Coffee_type_2…etc)
